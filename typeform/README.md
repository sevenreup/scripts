Scripts for some [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) work.

## Scoring logic
Working with updating independent variable updates when when a question is answered was annoying. This script just gets the auto-generated code for updating the main score and also updates an independent variable for that question.

This assumes your questions have numeric ids ie. 1 then it creates a variable by appending "q" to the id.
